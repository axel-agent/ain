"""Reject transfers whose amounts do not fit into the maximum amount.

The sum of the transfer amounts is the basis of the account consensus: the
source account is debited with the sum while every destination is credited
with its full amount. An amount that exceeds the maximum has to be rejected,
on the RPC level as well - otherwise the caller gets a transaction with an
amount that is not the one it asked for.

The amounts of a single recipient are aggregated before the transfer is
built. The aggregation has to report an overflow too: without the check the
sum would silently keep the amount of the first entry and the caller would
transfer the truncated amount.

Scenarios:

  S1  utxostoaccount with several recipients whose amounts sum up to more
      than the maximum is rejected
  S2  accounttoaccount with the same amounts is rejected
  S3  the amounts of a single recipient are aggregated first: an array that
      sums up to more than the maximum is rejected as well
  S4  a negative amount is rejected by the amount parser
  S5  a valid transfer still succeeds

No account may change in any of the rejected cases.
